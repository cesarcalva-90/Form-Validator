# Form-Validator

Lessons learned

1. Used HTML 5 form validation (e.g. form.checkValidity()) and JS custom validation as well.
2. Stored user data is shown on the console as an Object (ready to HTTP POST).
* I understand password handling is a delicate topic, but this is simply a front end application exercise/project.
